Robot Era Civilization: 
(Draft generated with DeepSeek assistance. Assuming human consciousness cannot be transferred. Friends with ideas are welcome to discuss 😋)

Core Concepts: Highly developed productivity driven by robots, socialized child-rearing, elimination of traditional family structures, decentralized open-source transparent AI management/execution/supervision, optional robot companions, pursuit of total equality from genes to education, 100% higher education, near-total recycling of assets post-mortem with minimal gifting, prohibition of non-medical genetic modification.

(Note: Sections marked with ",,," indicate areas where generation felt slightly off.)

Chapter 1: Civilization Cornerstones and Core Principles

1.1 Three Unshakable Cornerstones
· Principle of Natural Equality: Prohibition of any non-medical genetic modification. Humans accept the random results of the "natural lottery," while society ensures absolute equality of opportunity.
· Collective Rearing Contract: The biological rearing function of the family is completely socialized; emotional connection functions are diversified.
· Contribution-Security Cycle: Basic survival is unconditionally guaranteed, development resources are distributed based on contribution, property returns to the social pool after death, and robot consciousness registered under one's name is archived while the physical entity is recycled/destroyed.

1.2 Core Social Consensus
1. We are not isolated individuals, but cells of a civilizational life form.
2. Our highest mission is to spread the light of civilization to the ends of the universe.
3. Our dignity comes from creation, not possession.
4. Our freedom is bounded by not harming the survival of the civilization.
5. Our tools (Robots/AI) serve our vision forever.

Chapter 9: Cultural Core of Civilization

9.1 Core Narrative
"We were once children of Earth, now we are gardeners of the stars. Our tools extended our hands but did not replace our hearts. Our algorithms optimized choices but did not eliminate the unknown. What we built is not a perfect paradise, but an eternal school for explorers—where every soul has the chance to discover their unique light and weave that light into the net of civilization rushing towards the dark galaxy."
